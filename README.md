## 📂 Project Structure at a Glance

| Folder | Purpose | Run Order |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`opencv_servicies_copy/`** | Extracts surface normal vectors for every target point with OpenCV. | **1️⃣ Run first** |
| **`myopencv_copy/`** | Drives the UR‑5 robot arm, harvesting ~50 candidate trajectories with a Pareto‑dominance search, then picks the optimal one. | **2️⃣ Run after normals are ready** |

> **Why this order?**  
> The motion‑planner (**`myopencv_copy`**) needs the normals generated by **`opencv_servicies_copy`** to evaluate collision‑free, smooth trajectories.


To open the simulation world in GAZEBO, download the folder **ur_app** through [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xmwS8ozH2GyCBaR0FgzfQC4MRwFhqW7f?usp=drive_link).

## 🛠️ Quick‑Start

1. **Launch the Gazebo world (Download in Google drive)**

   ```bash
   roslaunch ur_app spawn_ur5_hammer_camer
   ```

2. **Click the Play ▶️ button in Gazebo.**
3. **Compute normals (opens a preview window):**
   ```bash
   rosrun opencv_servicies_copy axes_plane_all
   ```
4. **Search & optimise paths (≈ 10 min for 50 paths):**
   ```bash
   rosrun myopencv_copy normal_improved_pareto2
   ```
  Tune runtime: decrease max_retries or lower the thread count in the script to sample fewer paths.

## 🚀 Results
Randoly searched path takes longer time and detour to reach the target point, which is apprenlty unreasonable movement. 
However, optimal path gurantees the successful task while balancing 3 different objectives such as minimum distance from the obstacles, joint length and smoothness.
